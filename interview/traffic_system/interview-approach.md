# Step 1: Clarify Requirements

## Functional Requirements:
- The system should control traffic signals at a single intersection (4 traffic lights as a unit).
- The system should manage automatic cycling through phases (NORTH → EAST → SOUTH → WEST).
- The system should handle emergency vehicle priority requests by pausing the automatic cycle.
    - During emergency: All signals turn RED, emergency direction gets GREEN, then resume cycle from pause.
- The system should track vehicle count at each approach.
- The system should prevent conflicting signals from being active simultaneously.
- The system should have configurable signal durations (RED, YELLOW, GREEN) for each direction.
- The system should allow dynamic adjustment of signal durations based on traffic conditions.

> **Interview Tip:** Always ask the interviewer to confirm the requirements before jumping into code. It shows clarity and alignment.

## Non-Functional Requirements:
- The system should respond to user actions within reasonable time.
- The system should have proper state transitions.
- The system should be scalable to multiple intersections.

## Edge Cases to Consider:
- Emergency vehicle request during signal change.
- Invalid signal state transitions (handled by State Pattern).
- Cycle pause/resume during emergency.

# Step 2: Identify Code Entities

### 1. Intersection (Core Entity)
- `id`: int [PK]
- `name`: String
- `trafficLights`: TrafficLight[] (4 lights: NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, WEST)
- `isEmergencyMode`: boolean
- `emergencyDirection`: Direction (nullable)
- `isCyclePaused`: boolean

### 2. IntersectionCycle
- `intersectionId`: int [FK]
- `currentPhase`: int (0=NORTH, 1=EAST, 2=SOUTH, 3=WEST)
- `isPaused`: boolean
- `pausedAtPhase`: int
- `phaseStartTime`: long (timestamp)

### 3. TrafficLight
- `direction`: Enum (NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, WEST)
- `currentState`: TrafficLightState (State Pattern implementation)

> **Valid Transitions:** RED → GREEN → YELLOW → RED  
> **Invalid Transitions:** RED → YELLOW, GREEN → RED (blocked by state pattern)

### 4. SignalTiming
- `intersectionId`: int [FK]
- `direction`: Enum (NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, WEST)
- `greenDuration`: int (seconds)
- `isDynamic`: boolean (for traffic-based adjustment)
- `yellowDuration` is a constant (3 seconds) for safety

### 5. VehicleCounter
- `direction`: Enum (NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, WEST)
- `count`: int
- `lastUpdate`: long (timestamp)

### 6. EmergencyRequest
- `id`: int [PK]
- `intersectionId`: int [FK]
- `direction`: Enum (NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, WEST)
- `duration`: int (seconds)
- `isActive`: boolean

### 7. TrafficLightState
- State interface for traffic light state management

### 8. RedState
- Concrete state for RED traffic light

### 9. GreenState
- Concrete state for GREEN traffic light

### 10. YellowState
- Concrete state for YELLOW traffic light

### 11. OffState
- Concrete state for OFF traffic light

> **Interview Tip:** Clearly defining entities with their attributes early in the design helps you map relationships, enforce rules (like valid state transitions), and implement patterns like State Pattern more effectively.

# Step 3: Visualize Interaction Flows

## 1. Intersection Management Flows:
### Intersection Creation Flow:
- Create intersection → Initialize 4 traffic lights → Set default signal timings → Start automatic cycle

### Intersection Status Flow:
- Request status → Return all signal states, cycle info, and current timings

## 2. Automatic Cycle Management Flows:
### Normal Cycle Flow:
- Cycle through phases: NORTH → EAST → SOUTH → WEST
- Each phase: GREEN (configurable duration) → YELLOW (configurable duration) → RED → Next phase
- State Pattern ensures valid transitions: RED → GREEN → YELLOW → RED

### Cycle Pause/Resume Flow:
- Pause cycle → Remember current phase → Resume from same phase

## 3. Signal Timing Management Flows:
### Timing Configuration Flow:
- Set signal timing → Update SignalTiming for direction → Apply to next cycle

### Dynamic Timing Adjustment Flow:
- Traffic condition detected → Calculate optimal timing → Update SignalTiming → Apply immediately or next cycle

## 4. Emergency Management Flows:
### Emergency Request Flow:
- Emergency request → PAUSE cycle → ALL signals transition to RED (following proper state sequence) → Emergency direction GREEN → Wait duration → Resume cycle from pause

### Emergency End Flow:
- End emergency → All signals transition to RED (following proper state sequence) → Resume cycle from paused phase

## 5. Vehicle Counting Flows:
### Count Update Flow:
- Vehicle detected → Update count for direction → Trigger dynamic timing adjustment if enabled (in future)

### Count Query Flow:
- Request count → Return vehicle count for direction

## 6. State Transition Flows:
### Valid State Transition Flow:
- `TrafficLight.turnGreen()` → `currentState.turnGreen(this)` → `setState(new GreenState())`

### Invalid State Transition Flow:
- `TrafficLight.turnYellow()` → `currentState.turnYellow(this)` → throws `InvalidStateTransitionException`

### Emergency State Transition Flow:
- Emergency transition → Check current state → Follow proper sequence (GREEN → YELLOW → RED) → Handle each state appropriately → Log transition sequence

# Step 4: Defines Class Structures & Relationships

## Layers of Architecture:
We will design the architecture layers of the system in a structured way, ensuring separation of concerns and modularity. The system will be organized into the following layers:

- **Client/UI Layer** → **Controller Layer** → **Service Layer** → **Domain Layer**

### Each layer has a distinct role:
- **Client/UI Layer:** Provides the interface for end users or external systems to interact with the traffic signal system (e.g., dashboards, mobile apps, APIs).
- **Controller Layer:** Acts as the entry point for requests, orchestrates calls to services, and converts input/output between the UI and business logic.
- **Service Layer:** Contains the business logic, rules, and workflows for managing intersections, cycles, emergencies, timings, and state transitions.
- **Domain Layer:** Defines the core entities, states, and relationships that model the real-world traffic signal system, independent of infrastructure or UI.

# Step 6: Apply OOP Principles & Design Patterns

The system design leverages key design patterns and OOP principles to ensure robust state handling, modular structure, and easy scalability across intersections.

## Design Patterns Used:
- **Repository Pattern:** Provides abstraction for all data access operations.
- **Service Layer Pattern:** Separates and centralizes business logic.
- **State Pattern:** Manages traffic light states and validates transitions.

## OOP Principles Applied:
- **Single Responsibility Principle:** Each class is focused on a single well-defined purpose.
- **Open/Closed Principle:** The system can be extended with new intersections or features without modifying existing code.
- **Encapsulation:** Domain objects protect and manage their own data and behavior internally.
- **Dependency Inversion Principle:** High-level services rely on repository interfaces rather than concrete implementations.

> **Interview Tip:** Emphasize how the State Pattern streamlines traffic light control logic and how the combination of repository and service layers ensures maintainability and scalability as the system grows.

# Step 7: Handle Edge Cases

## Edge Case Solutions:
- **Emergency vehicle request during signal change:** PAUSE the automatic cycle and handle emergency immediately
- **Invalid signal state transitions:** State Pattern enforces valid transitions (Red → Green → Yellow → Red) with emergency override
- **Cycle pause/resume during emergency:** Maintain exact pause state and resume from same phase
- **Dynamic timing adjustment during active cycle:** Apply timing changes to next cycle, not current
- **Traffic-based timing conflicts:** Validate timing changes within safe ranges (min/max durations)
- **State transition exceptions:** Handle `InvalidStateTransitionException` gracefully with logging

## Implementation Strategies:
- **Cycle Pause/Resume:** `IntersectionCycle` maintains pause state and resumes from exact phase
- **Safety Validation:** State Pattern enforces valid signal transitions (Red → Green → Yellow → Red) with emergency sequence handling
- **Emergency Scheduling:** Timer handles automatic emergency duration and resume
- **Timing Validation:** `TimingService` validates timing changes within safe ranges
- **Dynamic Adjustment:** Apply timing changes to next cycle to avoid mid-cycle disruptions
- **State Exception Handling:** Catch `InvalidStateTransitionException` and log for debugging
