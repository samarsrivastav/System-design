# Step 1: Clarify Requirements

## Functional Requirements

### Entry Flow
- Vehicle arrives at gate
- Assign slot based on vehicle type
- Generate ticket
- Mark slot as occupied
- Return entry response

### Exit Flow
- Present ticket
- Calculate fee using pricing rules (flat vs hourly)
- Process payment
- Release slot
- Return exit response with receipt

### Admin Flow
- Add/Edit/Delete floors and slots
- Define/update pricing rules
- View parking lot status

> **Interview Tip**: Always ask the interviewer to confirm the requirements before jumping into code. It shows clarity and alignment.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Scalability**: Multiple parking lots, thousands of slots
- **Availability**: Entry/Exit must work even if payment fails
- **Consistency**: Accurate slot status at all times
- **Extensibility**: Easy addition of new vehicle types or gateways
- **Security**: Role-based access for admin operations
- **Latency**: < 500ms for key flows

## Edge Cases to Consider
- Payment failure at exit
- Lost ticket
- System clock mismatch
- Slot marked occupied wrongly
